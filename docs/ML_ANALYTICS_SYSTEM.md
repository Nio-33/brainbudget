# BrainBudget Intelligent ML Analytics System

## Overview

The ML Analytics System provides ADHD-aware spending pattern analysis using machine learning techniques. It combines privacy-first data processing with neurodivergent-friendly insights to help users understand their financial behaviors and make informed decisions.

## üß† ADHD-Specific Features

### Core ADHD Patterns Detected
- **Impulse Spending**: Quick successive purchases, often during dopamine-seeking periods
- **Hyperfocus Spending**: Concentrated spending in single categories during focus sessions  
- **Forgotten Subscriptions**: Regular charges that may no longer provide value
- **Stress Spending**: Emotional spending during high-stress periods
- **Late Night Spending**: Transactions when executive function is fatigued
- **Executive Function Fatigue**: Spending patterns during low-energy periods

### ADHD-Friendly Design Principles
- **Gentle Language**: All insights use encouraging, non-judgmental language
- **Digestible Chunks**: Information presented in small, manageable pieces
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear charts and progress indicators for easy comprehension
- **Celebrate Progress**: Focus on positive patterns and small improvements
- **Flexible Analysis**: Adaptable to ADHD brain variability and changing patterns

### 4. ADHD Pattern Recognition
**Specialized detection for neurodivergent spending behaviors**

#### Impulse Spending Detection
```python
impulse_patterns = {
    'time_threshold': 300,  # seconds between transactions
    'amount_multiplier': 2.0,  # above average spending
    'categories': ['shopping', 'entertainment', 'dining'],
    'keywords': ['instant', 'sale', 'limited', 'now']
}
```

#### Hyperfocus Period Analysis
```python
hyperfocus_periods = {
    'transaction_density': 5,  # transactions per hour
    'category_concentration': 0.8,  # percentage in single category
    'duration_threshold': 3600  # seconds of sustained activity
}
```

#### Stress Spending Correlation
```python
stress_spending = {
    'deviation_threshold': 2.0,  # standard deviations from normal
    'time_patterns': ['late_night', 'weekend'],
    'categories': ['food', 'shopping', 'entertainment']
}
```

### 5. Category Trend Analysis
**Analyzes spending changes over time by category**

**Features:**
- Weekly trend calculation using linear regression
- Variability analysis for spending consistency
- ADHD-specific insights for each category
- Visual trend indicators (increasing/decreasing/stable)

**ADHD Insights by Category:**
- **Dining**: "Food spending often supports executive function - this is self-care!"
- **Shopping**: "Could be dopamine-seeking or hyperfocus periods - both are normal"
- **Entertainment**: "Investing in joy and stimulation is important for ADHD brains"

    'aggregate_only': False,       # Individual analysis with protection
    'retention_days': 365,         # 1-year maximum retention
    'min_analysis_transactions': 50  # Minimum data for analysis
}
```

```python
scores = {
    'anomaly_score': 0.15,      # How unusual (0-1)
    'impulse_score': 0.8,       # Impulse likelihood (0-1)  
    'recurring_score': 0.95,    # Subscription likelihood (0-1)
    'emotional_score': 0.3     # Emotional trigger likelihood (0-1)
}
```

### Real-Time Insights
**Immediate feedback on new transactions:**
- **High Anomaly**: "üí° This transaction is unusual for you"
- **Possible Impulse**: "üß† This might be an impulse purchase - totally normal!"
