# BrainBudget Intelligent Notification System

## Overview

BrainBudget features a comprehensive, ADHD-friendly notification system that provides gentle financial reminders and encouraging messages without overwhelming users. The system is designed with neurodivergent brains in mind, offering customizable experiences that respect user boundaries and preferences.

## üß† ADHD-Friendly Design Principles

### Core Philosophy
- **Gentle, not jarring**: All notifications use encouraging language and avoid shame or judgment
- **Respectful boundaries**: Quiet hours, rate limiting, and user control prevent notification fatigue
- **Positive reinforcement**: Focus on celebrating achievements and providing supportive guidance
- **Clear next steps**: Every notification includes actionable guidance
- **User control**: Extensive customization options to match individual needs

### Key Features
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum daily notification limits prevent overwhelm
- **Quiet Hours**: Automatic notification blocking during rest times
- **Tone Customization**: Choose between gentle/encouraging vs. direct/clear communication styles
- **Emergency Controls**: Easy snooze and disable options for tough days
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works with or without browser notifications enabled
