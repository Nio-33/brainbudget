## 🎨 ADHD-Specific Design Principles

### Core UX Philosophy

#### 1. Cognitive Load Reduction
```yaml
Principle: Minimize mental effort required for every interaction
Implementation:
  - Single-focus pages with clear primary actions
  - Progressive disclosure of information
  - Simplified navigation with breadcrumbs
  - Reduced color complexity (3-color max per screen)
```

#### 2. Gentle, Non-Judgmental Interface
```yaml
Principle: Support and encourage rather than criticize
Implementation:
  - Positive language in all messaging
  - "Oops" instead of "Error" in user-facing text
  - Celebration of small wins and progress
  - Gentle suggestions rather than harsh corrections
```

#### 3. Executive Function Support
```yaml
Principle: Compensate for ADHD executive dysfunction
Implementation:
  - Clear next steps always visible
  - Automatic saving of partial progress
  - Gentle reminders without pressure
  - Goal decomposition into micro-tasks
```

#### 4. Emotional Regulation
```yaml
Principle: Reduce financial anxiety and overwhelm
Implementation:
  - Calming color palette (blues, greens, soft grays)
  - Smooth animations to reduce jarring transitions
  - Optional "breathing space" between actions
  - Stress-reducing visual elements
```
